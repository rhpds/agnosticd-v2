= AgnosticD V2 Conversion Guide

AgnosticD V2 introduces significant code cleanup, streamlining, and logical improvements over V1. This guide outlines the essential changes you need to make when migrating AgnosticD configs from V1 to V2.

NOTE: This guide covers all known changes. We will update it as additional variables and modifications are identified.

== Common Changes

=== Core Terminology and Structure
* *Configuration naming*: `env_type` is now `config`
* *Cloud provider*: The `ec2` cloud provider has been renamed to `aws` for consistency
* *Supported providers*: Currently, only `aws` and `none` cloud providers are supported and functional. This document will be updated as additional cloud providers are converted and modernized.

=== Cloud Provider Management
Cloud providers are now managed in a separate collection rather than as part of the core repository. You can lock a specific version by setting the `cloud_provider_version` variable to a branch or tag. If not specified, the system defaults to `main`.

*Cloud provider playbook locations*: Cloud provider playbooks remain in AgnosticD V2 but have moved to the `cloud_provider/{{ cloud_provider }}` directory. Valid playbooks include:

* `infrastructure_deployment.yml`
* `destroy_env.yml`
* `lifecycle.yml`

All roles have been or should be refactored into collections (following the `aws` cloud provider model).

=== Plugin Consolidation
All AgnosticD plugins are now consolidated into a single collection embedded in the AgnosticD V2 repository (`/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/agnosticd/core`). You must use fully qualified plugin names in AgnosticD and workload code:

* `agnosticd.core.agnosticd_user_info` (Action plugin/Module)
* `agnosticd.core.agnosticd_odcr` (Action plugin)
* `agnosticd.core.agnosticd_user_data` (Lookup plugin)
* `agnosticd.core.bitwarden` (Lookup plugin)
* `agnosticd.core.unvault_string` (Lookup plugin)

*Compatibility note*: Lookup plugins are symlinked to `/ansible/lookup_plugins` for Babylon compatibility. Babylon uses `unvault_string` to set variables from Vault, and modifying Babylon would break existing deployments.

=== Deprecated Features
* *Software deployment*: `software_to_deploy` no longer exists. It was OpenShift-specific and has been replaced by `host_ocp4_deploy_installation_method` for the `openshift-cluster` config.
* *Role directories*: The following role directories have been consolidated and no longer exist:
** `roles_infra`
** `roles_studentvm`
** `roles_ocp_workloads`

=== Execution Environment Changes
Collections and roles are now installed *before* the `ansible/main.yml` playbook executes. This requires a new Execution Environment image. The current full execution environment image is:

[source]
----
quay.io/agnosticd/ee-multicloud:chained-2025-06-24
----

IMPORTANT: Note the `chained` prefix before the build date.

=== Bastion Host Changes
* *No Python virtualenv*: There is no longer a Python `virtualenv` installed on the bastion host
* *Container execution*: The entire deployer runs within the execution environment container
* *Bastion task delegation*: If you must run tasks on the bastion, pin them using `delegate_to: "{{ groups['bastions'][0] }}"`
* *Kubernetes tasks*: All k8s tasks should run from within the execution environment

== OpenShift Cluster Changes

=== Configuration Updates
* *Config name*: `ocp4-cluster` has been renamed to `openshift-cluster`
* *Terminology*: The term `master` has been replaced with `control_plane` where possible
* *Workload naming*: `infra_workloads` has been renamed to `workloads`
* *Workload requirements*: Workloads now require fully qualified role names
* *Removed features*: `student_workloads` have been removed

== DNS Changes

TBD

== Common Role Changes

=== Package Installation
[source,yaml]
----
install_common_packages: true

# To install extra packages (beyond the common package list)
# host_common_packages_extra_packages:
# - java-17-openjdk
# - maven
# - podman

# Run a full dnf update on all hosts
host_common_packages_update_all: true
----

=== Satellite Repository Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
install_satellite_repositories: true

# Required variables from secrets:
# host_satellite_repositories_hostname:
# host_satellite_repositories_ha:
# host_satellite_repositories_org:
# host_satellite_repositories_activationkey:
----

=== Bastion Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
install_bastion: true
bastion_student_user_name: lab-user
bastion_install_ftl: false
----

== Migration Example: OpenShift Cluster (Workshop) Config

This section provides a step-by-step example of converting an OpenShift Cluster workshop configuration from V1 to V2.

=== Initial Setup
. *Create directory structure*: Create a new directory in AgnosticD V2. The `agd_v2` directory already exists, and the `account.yml` file contains default variable mappings for Babylon deployment.

. *Copy configuration files*: Copy the following files from your V1 config:
** `common.yaml`
** `dev.yaml`
** `description.adoc`

=== Babylon Metadata Changes
Update the following Babylon `__meta__` settings:

* *Asset UUID*: Generate a new `asset_uuid`
* *Execution environment*: Change the image to `quay.io/agnosticd/ee-multicloud:chained-2025-06-24`
* *Display name*: Update to something unique (for example, add "AgdV2")
* *Source reference*: Update as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
deployer:
  scm_url: https://github.com/rhpds/agnosticd_v2
  scm_ref: main
----

=== Mandatory Variable Changes
Make these required variable updates:

* Change `env_type: ocp4-cluster` → `config: openshift-cluster`
* Change `cloud_provider: ec2` → `cloud_provider: aws`
* Add `cloud_provider_version: main`
* Remove `software_to_deploy`

=== Collection Requirements
Add the required collections (minimum configuration):

[source,yaml]
----
# ===================================================================
# Additional Collections & roles to be installed for this config
# ===================================================================
requirements_content:
  collections:
  # Core OpenShift Workloads
  - name: https://github.com/agnosticd/core_workloads.git
    type: git
    version: main
----

=== Bastion Variable Updates
Update bastion-related variables:

* `install_student_user` → `bastion_setup_student_user`
* `student_name` → `bastion_student_user_name`
* `student_sudo` → `bastion_student_user_sudo`

*Additional bastion student user variables:*

* `bastion_student_user_password: ""`
* `bastion_student_user_password_length: 12` (Password length for generated passwords)
* `bastion_student_user_key: ""` (Optional public key for authorized_keys)
* `bastion_student_user_set_user_data: true` (Set agnosticd_user_info data with bastion access)
* `bastion_student_user_show_user_info: true` (Set agnosticd_user_info message with bastion access)

=== Node Variable Updates
Update node variables (master → control_plane) if defined:

* `master_instance_count` → `control_plane_instance_count`
* `master_instance_type_family` → `control_plane_instance_type_family`
* `master_instance_type_size` → `control_plane_instance_type_size`
* `master_instance_type` → `control_plane_instance_type`
* `master_storage_type` → `control_plane_storage_type`

=== Workload Configuration
Change the `infra_workloads` list to `workloads` and use fully qualified collection names:

.Before (V1)
[source,yaml]
----
infra_workloads:
- ocp4_workload_authentication
- ocp4_workload_cert_manager
----

.After (V2)
[source,yaml]
----
workloads:
- agnosticd.core_workloads.ocp4_workload_authentication_htpasswd
- agnosticd.core_workloads.ocp4_workload_cert_manager
----

=== Workload-Specific Changes

==== Authentication Workload
The `ocp4_workload_authentication` workload has been renamed to `ocp4_workload_authentication_htpasswd` because it only supports htpasswd authentication (LDAP support has been discontinued).

*Configuration updates:*

* *Remove*: `ocp4_workload_authentication_idm_type: htpasswd`
* *Change*: `ocp4_workload_authentication_remove_kubeadmin: true` → `ocp4_workload_authentication_htpasswd_remove_kubeadmin: true`
* *Change*: `ocp4_workload_authentication_admin_user: admin` → `ocp4_workload_authentication_htpasswd_admin_user: admin`
